## Contribution guidelines

Make sure you create a new branch following the below format every time you upload your code

```bash
git checkout -b "your name-feature"
```

When creating a PR, make sure to add [NO-??] to link a task from Notion with your PR. Example:

```
[NO-69] Centered a div after 5 days
```

Make sure you request review from at least one other person and have it approved before you merge your branch to main. You can always request me @weebao and I will make sure to review it by the end of the day.

Also, please delete the branch after having it merged to keep things clean :D
